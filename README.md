# 👋 Hi, I’m Oluwafemi — On-Chain Builder & Web3 Developer

I’m a blockchain developer passionate about building open, permissionless, and composable tools across multiple chains. My work focuses on creating real, functional on-chain products that solve problems around identity, tokens, payments, and user experience.

## 🚀 What I Build
I work across several ecosystems including **Ethereum**, **Base**, **Stacks**, and other EVM chains. My projects typically involve:

- **Dapps with full wallet integration** (EVM & non-EVM)
- **Smart contract interactions** for tokens, signing, authentication, and tracking
- **On-chain dashboards** (contributors dashboards, leaders dashboards, token discovery, charts, analytics)
- **Gas-optimized systems** for batch transactions, savings vaults, and automated processes
- **User-focused experiences**—clear UI, fast performance, and mobile-friendly design

## 🔗 Chains I Build On
- **Ethereum** — contracts, dapps, tooling  
- **Base** — L2-native apps, memes, growth dashboards  
- **Stacks** — Bitcoin-secured apps, STX Vaults, BTC-backed savings  
- **Other EVM chains** — cross-chain features and integrations

## 📦 Projects I’ve Worked On
- **STX Bitcoin-Backed Vault** — a Bitcoin-anchored savings vault powered by Stacks  
- **Contributors & Leaders Dashboard** for Stacks projects  
- **Token Discovery Tools** — auto-detect ERC-20s, show price + charts  
- **Message Signer App** — web signing + wallet connection  
- **Batch Token Sender** — optimized on-chain multi-send system  
- **Base chain dashboard tools** for user growth, analytics, and social proof  

## 🛠️ What I Use
- **Next.js / React / Remix**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Ethers.js / Viem / Web3.js**
- **Stacks.js / Hiro APIs**
- **Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode**
- **Redis caching & server-side fetch optimization**

## 🧠 What Drives Me
I build because I believe on-chain systems should be **simple, transparent, and accessible**—especially for users in emerging markets. My mission is to turn complex blockchain functionality into smooth, reliable products anyone can use.

## 🌍 Let’s Collaborate
If you’re building something onchain and need a developer who understands **multi-chain architecture, UI/UX, smart contract flows, and crypto-native user behavior**, I’m open to collaboration or contributions.
